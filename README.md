# Hospeed

Hospeed is a web application that provides real-time information on hospital traffic to help users make informed decisions about which hospital to visit. The app integrates hospital APIs to fetch traffic data, allowing users to see which hospitals are busy and which ones have fewer patients.

## Introduction

Hospeed aims to streamline the decision-making process for individuals seeking hospital care by providing them with up-to-date traffic information. This way, users can avoid long wait times and choose the hospital that best suits their needs. The project utilizes Flask for the backend, along with a simple frontend interface.
